     * The transitions below need some explanation, I guess:
     *
     * We transition two properties: visibility and opacity.
     *   * opacity for a nice fade-out / fade-in effect
     *   * visibility so that no mouseover / mouseout events are being fired
     *
     * We generally use the shorthand notation 'transition' for the basic setup,
     * but as visibility is a value that can only be tarnsitioned between
     * 'hidden' and 'visible' (no values inbetween), we have to use the
     * 'transition-delay' to mangle with the delay of the visibility.
     *
     * The setting here are for showing, where we immidiately want the
     * 'visibility: visible' but want to have some time (0.3s) for the opacity
     * animation.
     *
     * In the case where we want to hide, svg .k-d3-shape-group-hidden below,
     * the delay is set to something else.
     *
